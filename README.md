# Abbott

Abbott is a "phone-system-in-a-box" that routes your calls and text messages however you like.  Abbot is aimed towards hackers willing to take control of their phone communications in a way that works for them.  Abbott is a way to decentralize calls and texts from relying on one physical phone.

## Getting Started
Abbott is meant to deployed on any environment capable of running MongoDB, Redis, and NodeJS.  Currently the only supported environment is Heroku but work is being made towards a more multi-platform approach.  A shell script is forthcoming to automate a large majority of the process.
